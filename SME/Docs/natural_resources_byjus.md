What are Natural Resources?
Natural resources can be defined as the resources that exist (on the planet) independent of human actions.

These are the resources that are found in the environment and are developed without the intervention of humans. Common examples of natural resources include air, sunlight, water, soil, stone, plants, animals and fossil fuels.

Natural resources are naturally occurring materials that are useful to man or could be useful under conceivable technological, economic or social circumstances or supplies drawn from the earth, supplies such as food, building and clothing materials, fertilizers, metals, water and geothermal power. For a long time, natural resources were the domain of the natural sciences.

What are the Different Types of Natural Resources?
Based on the availability are two types of natural resources:

Renewable: resources that are available in infinite quantity and can be used repeatedly are called renewable resources. Example: Forest, wind, water, etc.
Non-Renewable: resources that are limited in abundance due to their non-renewable nature and whose availability may run out in the future are called non-renewable resources. Examples include fossil fuels, minerals, etc.
Difference between Renewable and Non-Renewable Resources
Renewable resource	Non-renewable resource
It can be renewed as it is available in infinite quantity	Once completely consumed, it cannot be renewed due to limited stock
Sustainable in nature	Exhaustible in nature
Low cost and environment-friendly	High cost and less environment-friendly
Replenish quickly	Replenish slowly or do not replenish naturally at all
The 5 Most Important Natural Resources are:
Air: Clean air is important for all the plants, animals and humans to survive on this planet. So, it is necessary to take measures to reduce air pollution.
Water: 70% of the Earth is covered in water and only 2 % of that is freshwater. Initiative to educate and regulate the use of water should be taken.
Soil: Soil is composed of various particles and nutrients. It helps plants grow.
Iron: It is found as mineral silica and is used to build strong weapons, transportation and buildings
Forests: Forests provide clean air and preserve the ecology of the world. Trees are being cut for housing and  construction projects
Frequently Asked Questions – FAQs
Q1
What are the key natural resources?
Distribution of the world’s most important natural resources. Other resources include mineral resources such as copper, gold and diamonds, energy resources such as gas, oil, and uranium, as well as agricultural and logging land resources.

Q2
What are the uses of natural resources?
Minerals, forest products, water, and soil are just a few of the natural resources that human beings use to produce energy and make use of things. Within a few years or decades, certain natural resources can be replicated. These are referred to as renewable resources.

Q3
How do humans depend on natural resources?
Living things need the land’s water, air, and energy, and they live in places with the things they need. For all they do, humans use natural resources.

Q4
What are the characteristics of natural resources?
On Earth, it requires sunshine, air, water, land (including all minerals) along with all the plants, crops and animal life which live naturally on or within the characteristics and substances previously identified.

Q5
Does recycling save natural resources?
By sustainability, recycling also saves energy and natural resources. We can save natural resources by using materials more than once. Recycling saves trees and water in the case of paper. Growing up to 17 trees saves up to one ton of paper from recycled stock and uses 50 percent less energy.
